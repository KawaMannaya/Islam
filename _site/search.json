However, the strength of this connection is not always easily identifiable. Hence, I made a decision to see if the increased use of social media is indeed linked to the sleep duration of students being lesser.\nFor this study, I utilized a publicly available dataset that had records of 1,000 students. The dataset comprises information related to daily social media usage, sleep duration, study hours, stress-related indicators, mental health ratings, and demographic traits.\nThe main inquiry that is directing this analysis is:\nIs increased social media usage a predictor of decreased sleep duration among students?"

    "section": "Results & Interpretation",
    "text": "Results & Interpretation\nNumerous prior studies and public viewpoints have indicated that an increased usage of social media has a negative impact on sleep, nevertheless, the current analysis has not corroborated this assumption with the given dataset. The regression analysis pointed out that there was a non-significant effect of social media hours on sleep duration.\nTo begin with, it might be that the sleep habits are predominantly affected by other factors such as the pressure from academia, stress, physical activity, mental state, or personal time-management practices. Furthermore, students might keep their sleep time the same but move it around in order to use social media without affecting the total sleep duration.\nIn addition, social media being the only digital activity that is accounted for might not reflect the whole scenario of one’s digital habits. The type of content that is being consumed, the time of the day when it is being used (especially right before sleeping), and a person’s predisposition to being affected by the light from the screen may, in fact, be playing a more crucial role than just the amount of time spent daily.\nIt is of great significance to note that a non-existent relationship in this research does not mean that social media is completely and universally powerless over sleep. Instead, it suggests that social media usage alone did not serve as a determining factor for sleep duration in the case of this particular group of 1,000 students."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nIn this study of 1,000 university students, the data analysis detected no significant link between the amount of time spent on social media and the length of sleep. The effect size was calculated as very small, which was not statistically different from zero, thus it was inferred that the variations in hours spent on social media did not predict the variations in sleep duration significantly. The regression diagnostics verified that the assumptions of linearity, normality, homogeneity of variances, and independence were adequately met, thus it was confirmed that the null results reflect the real pattern in the data and not an error in modelling. This implies that total daily social media use is not the only factor that contributes to the differences in sleep duration among students. On the contrary, social media usage was not associated with sleep negatively. Thus, the hypothesis that people using social media more tend to sleep less was rejected by the data. The findings were presented in an impartial manner and without wringing an anticipated result. It is recommended that subsequent research examines the more specific factors such as time-of-day usage, content type, objective sleep measures, and other behavioral or environmental moderators."

    "text": "Personal Reflection\nThis project has been useful to me in realizing the ways of organizing and presenting behavioral data through graphs, and also to applying regression models for the purpose of testing social questions more realistically. My initial assumption was that the relationship between social media and sleep would be very strong, but what I found out was that human behavior is dictated by a great many factors that overlap. The project improved my skills in data storytelling and confident use of statistics."
